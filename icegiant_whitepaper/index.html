At the same time, DeFi technology, as an important branch of blockchain technology, provides more efficient, secure and sustainable solutions for the management and trading of digital assets. Therefore, IceGiant came into being, combining the needs of DeFi technology and database management, aiming to provide users with digital asset-based data management and transaction services, so that data has more value and possibilities.</p><p>The purpose of the IceGiant DeFi database is to realize data management and transactions of digital assets, so that data has more value and possibilities. By combining DeFi technology and NFT technology, IceGiant transforms data into digital assets for transaction and management, provides efficient, safe and sustainable data solutions, and provides more data application scenarios such as data market, data governance, data storage and data analysis. Comprehensive, efficient and safe services. At the same time, data assetization is becoming more and more important in the digital economy for the following reasons:</p><ol><li>Data is the core asset of the digital economy. Data capitalization can make data the real wealth of the digital economy and create more value for enterprises and individuals.</li><li>The demand in the digital asset trading market continues to increase, and the transaction and management of digital assets requires more efficient, secure and sustainable solutions. The development of DeFi technology provides better options for the transaction and management of digital assets.</li><li>Data assetization can improve the circulation and availability of data, make data more flexible and convenient to apply to different scenarios, and provide more possibilities for the development of the digital economy.</li><li>With the continuous improvement of the degree of digitization, the demand for data management and transactions is also increasing, and data assetization provides more possibilities and opportunities for the development of the digital economy.</li></ol><p>Therefore, data assetization is becoming more and more important in the digital economy, and the IceGiant DeFi database was born to realize data management and transactions of digital assets, providing more efficient, secure and reliable data management and digital asset transactions Continuous solutions to help maximize the value of data.</p><h1 id=motivation>Motivation</h1><p>For the web3 field, there is currently no way to write a complete client application as easily as in web2, and make it completely decentralized. In web2, you start a database on AWS and let your client application call the database for reading and writing. But there is nothing like it in web3. You can&rsquo;t just write data to Ethereum, which is too expensive for most users. Storage protocols such as Filecoin and Arweave are mainly used to archive data, but they do not provide enterprise-level performance guarantee for writing and reading data.</p><p>Another flaw of the Web2 database is that users cannot convert their own data into digital assets for transaction and management. This means that users cannot obtain economic value from their own data, nor can they obtain benefits through data transactions. This limits the utilization and value realization of users&rsquo; own data.</p><p>Here, we introduce IceGiant, which is a scalable web3 DeFi database, which uses RESP and SQL protocols to support dApps fast access and use of decentralized databases.IceGiant integrates NFT and DeFi technologies, and users&rsquo; database data can be converted into digital assets, providing more possibilities for data management and transactions. This fusion can combine database and digital asset management to provide a more complete solution for data management and data asset transactions. Through the empowerment of data application access protocol, NFT and DeFi technology, IceGiant can provide users with more efficient, secure and sustainable data management and transaction services, and provide more possibilities for the realization and utilization of data value.</p><p>The key to mass adoption of web3 technology is that it can provide end users with the user experience they have grown accustomed to in web2. The loading time of a web page directly affects the conversion rate of your business. Walmart found that for every second of reduction in page load time, conversion rates increased by 2%. The gateway loading time of web3 distributed storage needs to be optimized. The core goal of IceGiant is to provide users with a fast and rich data structure DeFi database system.</p><p>Master the data, master the future! IceGiant is a DeFi technology-based database that makes data management and transactions more efficient, secure and sustainable. We convert data into digital assets for transaction and management, so that data has unlimited possibilities!

The application layer includes application scenarios such as data market, data governance, data storage and data analysis, providing users with comprehensive, efficient, safe and sustainable data solutions. The DAO layer provides efficient and secure financial management and transaction services for data DAO, improving the efficiency and sustainability of data DAO.</p><p>IceGiant&rsquo;s technical advantages include data management and transaction solutions based on DeFi technology&rsquo;s digital assetization, NFT technology&rsquo;s digital assetization, decentralized architecture and scalability. Using DeFi technology, IceGiant combines data management and digital asset transactions to realize digital asset-based data management and transactions, allowing data to have more value and possibilities. Use NFT technology to convert data into digital assets for transaction and management, improve data circulation and usability, and make data more valuable and flexible. A decentralized architecture is adopted to ensure the security and reliability of data, to ensure that data is not tampered with and lost, and to protect the privacy and security of user data. It is scalable, adopts efficient query speed and scalable architecture, improves the efficiency and speed of data analysis, and can expand smoothly at the same time.</p><h2 id=defi>DeFi</h2><p>DeFi technology is the abbreviation of distributed financial technology, which is the application of blockchain technology in the financial field. IceGiant uses DeFi technology to realize data management and transactions of digital assets. DeFi technology mainly has the following characteristics: decentralization, openness, transparency, programmability and interoperability. These features can ensure the security and reliability of data management and transactions, while improving the circulation and availability of data.</p><p>Specifically, IceGiant uses DeFi smart contracts to implement database management and transactions. A smart contract is a self-executing contract that contains rules and terms for data management and transactions. Through smart contracts, functions such as data capitalization, digital asset transactions, and financial management can be realized. At the same time, smart contracts have the characteristics of non-tamperable modification and automatic execution, which can ensure the safety and reliability of data management and transactions.</p><h2 id=nft>NFT</h2><p>NFT technology is the abbreviation of non-homogeneous token technology, which is a digital assetization technology. IceGiant uses NFT technology to convert data into digital assets for transaction and management. The main feature of NFT technology is that each token is unique and irreplaceable, and can represent unique assets or rights. This can ensure the circulation and availability of data, while increasing the value and flexibility of data.</p><p>Specifically, IceGiant uses NFT technology to convert the data inside the database into digital assets. Each digital asset is unique and can represent a specific data asset or interest. Through NFT technology, data capitalization and digital asset transactions can be realized, so that data has more value and possibilities. At the same time, NFT technology can guarantee the uniqueness and irreplaceability of digital assets, avoid repeated transactions and use of data, and protect the copyright and intellectual property rights of data.</p><h2 id=data-decentralization>Data decentralization</h2><p>IceGiant adopts a unique decentralized architecture to ensure the security and reliability of data, to ensure that data is not tampered with and lost, and to protect the privacy and security of user data. Decentralized architecture means that there is no centralized control mechanism or single point of failure in the system, but the management and operation of the system are realized through distributed nodes. This can ensure the security and reliability of the system and avoid single point failures and attacks.</p><p>Specifically, IceGiant uses the IceFireDB decentralized storage engine to implement a decentralized architecture, storing data in distributed nodes, and each node has the same copy and permissions. Through consensus algorithms and smart contracts, information sharing and interaction between nodes can be guaranteed to ensure data security and reliability. At the same time, the decentralized architecture can protect the privacy and security of user data and avoid data leakage and abuse.</p><h2 id=scalability>Scalability</h2><p>IceGiant is scalable, adopts efficient query speed and scalable architecture, improves the efficiency and speed of data analysis, and can expand smoothly at the same time. Scalability means that the system can be expanded horizontally or vertically according to demand to meet the ever-increasing user demand and data volume. In IceGiant, scalability is very important, because the demand and data volume of data management and transactions may continue to increase.</p><p>Specifically, IceGiant adopts efficient query speed and scalable architecture to improve the efficiency and speed of data analysis. At the same time, the use of distributed nodes and consensus algorithms can smoothly expand the scale and performance of the system. This can ensure the reliability and stability of the system, while improving user experience and data circulation.</p><h1 id=technology-advantages>Technology Advantages</h1><p>IceGiant also supports the development of some features that were previously not possible in web3. By providing developers with full-featured NoSQL and SQL engines, IceGiant allows developers to perform complex queries on massive data sets in milliseconds. This level of optimization can further push web3 applications into a data-driven state without sacrificing the decentralized nature of their products.</p><p>Using the advantages of IceGiant can be divided into four different categories:</p><ol><li>Accelerate the dApp development process: By using RESP and SQL protocols, developers can quickly build and deploy decentralized applications, helping web2/web3 applications quickly access data decentralization capabilities.</li><li>Forge the value of database assets in applications: IceGiant converts data in user databases into digital assets by combining NFT and DeFi technologies, providing more possibilities for data management and transactions. Enhance user data transaction capabilities and provide a more sustainable economic infrastructure for data transactions and utilization.</li><li>Fast and secure database storage and retrieval: Since IceGiant uses technologies such as data fragmentation, data retrieval gateway, and FlowShield decentralized security network, it can provide fast data storage and query speed. At the same time, through the support of NFT and DeFi technology, IceGiant can inspire global database manufacturers to provide more data access points, thereby enhancing users&rsquo; data storage and retrieval performance.</li><li>Enhance dApp data combination and complex data usage scenarios: Through NFT and DeFi technology, IceGiant converts data into digital assets for transaction and management, providing more possibilities for data. This can provide more efficient, secure and sustainable solutions for data markets, governance, storage and analysis, etc., while promoting the development of the Web3 ecosystem. The integration of these technologies can allow users to better grasp and trade their own data, realize the maximum value of data, and promote the expansion of data application scenarios and value.</li></ol><h1 id=system-composition>System composition</h1><h2 id=storage-network-structure>Storage network structure</h2><p>Although all IceGiant nodes are in the same P2P network, the structure of the network can be decomposed according to the data set, which is the data tenant isolation area, which refers to the database area used by a specific application on top of the IceGiant protocol. Different from the traditional blockchain network, IceGiant nodes are only responsible for interacting with peers operating the same data set, and are not responsible for any data of other data sets. Peer IceGiant node sets form a high-availability data storage area.</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34047788/195057766-c35b7455-95e1-4bb4-a4a2-ad0f6c2989b6.png alt=image></p><h2 id=trusted-storage-mechanism>Trusted storage mechanism</h2><p>The NoSQL storage layer of each individual IceGiant mainly includes the codec layer and the underlying KV storage layer. the underlying KV engine currently supports levelDB, badgerDB, IPFS and OSS, and the main data storage includes two ways:</p><ol><li>instruction broadcast model based on IPFS-log</li><li>Native data storage model based on IPFS</li></ol><p>The specific storage model design will be further described in Section 3.3 NoSQL Storage Engine. Multiple IceGiant nodes will be divided into groups according to data sets, and each group will form a highly available storage area structure.</p><h2 id=trusted-storage-smart-contracts>Trusted storage smart contracts</h2><p>IceGiant mainly uses smart contracts to build a decentralized storage engine strategy center. Our goal is to build a database platform that can run by itself and be governed by the public. At present, the running carrier of smart contracts mainly considers EVM-compatible virtual machine environment. EVM allows us to make trusted calculations and provide services closer to data storage, and provides users with more reliable data operation credibility.</p><p>Intelligent contract functions mainly include:</p><ol><li>Data set and multi-tenant decentralized trusted management</li><li>User account and access credentials management</li><li>The database is written into the contract storage of instruction set for data trusted synchronization and data consistency verification.</li></ol><h2 id=query-structure>Query structure</h2><p>In each query submitted to a node, there are the following pieces of different data:</p><ol><li>query: Standard RESP、SQL protocol query</li><li>timestamp</li><li>query hash</li><li>query id</li><li>RSA signature</li></ol><p>Every time data is written, the node ensures that the RSA signature is valid for the associated key of the fund pool, and the public key is stored in the smart contract. After verifying the signature, the node checks the timestamp to ensure that it falls within the valid time range of the current block.</p><p>Once the timestamp is accepted, the node checks the uniqueness of the query ID. The query ID is guaranteed by the node that it can&rsquo;t be duplicated within the batch within the current time range, and it can take random 64 characters associated with the query. If the node is a leader, it is also necessary to maintain the current state of the data set in the database.</p><h1 id=node-architecture>Node Architecture</h1><h2 id=reverse-proxy>Reverse proxy</h2><p>The reverse proxy server is the entry point for all requests sent to the node. On the IceGiant node, the reverse proxy server has four main purposes:</p><ol><li>Manage TLS/SSL certificates to ensure encrypted communication with any client/peer node.</li><li>Implement CORS (cross-source resource sharing) configuration, and specify which sources (client and peer) to accept data read/write from.</li><li>Route incoming requests to the correct gateway or synchronizer, and prevent bypassing any advanced request gateway.</li><li>Provide static resources from the local file system.</li></ol><h2 id=icegiant-synchronize>IceGiant synchronize</h2><p>IceGiant Synchronizer is an application directly above the database engine. All incoming database requests pass through IceGiant Synchronizer, which determines whether the requests should be processed, whether data writes should be propagated to other parts of the network, and whether local data should be written and customer requests should be responded to.</p><p>IceGiant Synchronizer can also provide data write aggregation function, allowing multiple data requests to be merged and written into a single network storage request. It also allows users to cross-mix data sets between different nodes, encouraging further data decentralization, while keeping the operation overhead low.</p><h2 id=nosql-and-sqlite-storage-engine>NoSQL and SQLite storage engine</h2><p>The core of each node is the database engine. By default, IceGiant node integrates KV storage engines such as levelDB, badgerDB, IPFS, OSS, etc., and implements the protocol coding layer of NoSQL on the KV storage relationship. Currently, the data storage of NoSQL mainly includes the following two ways:</p><p><strong>The first implementation: instruction broadcast model based on ipfs-log</strong>: Based on ipfs-log,crdt and libp2p(pubsub), an immutable and operation-based conflict-free replication data model for distributed systems is implemented. Based on ipfs-log, various data structures such as event and kv are encapsulated, and multi-node database instruction broadcast is implemented based on this engine;At that bottom of IceFireDB, we abstract the variable kv engine base on badgerdb and leveldb. any node will broadcast the whole network when it is writing instruction, and the bottom driver of IceFireDB of each node will execute the broadcast instruction to ensure the final consistency of data.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=display:flex><span>           <span style=color:#a6e22e>Log</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>A</span>                <span style=color:#a6e22e>Log</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>B</span>

At first, there is an ipfs driver in the IceFireDB driver layer, which will encode and process the upper-level commands into a unified kv data structure, store and change the value, and the generated new cid will be connected with key. However, at present, there is no key broadcast network with multiple nodes and data synchronization.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Each IceGiant node is a perfect NoSQL database engine, and each database engine is configured to allow access only through the IceGiant synchronizer running on the same machine. There are the following considerations in doing so:</p><ol><li>Restrict synchronizer&rsquo;s access to database, and reduce the chance of user&rsquo;s error. Non-propagating data writes must be clearly identified by IceGiant synchronizer, rather than accidentally submitted to NoSQL database storage engine, which makes similar nodes in the network contain the same data as much as possible.</li><li>Restrict access to IceGiant synchronizer through reverse proxy or other advanced gateways, so that database users can reduce attack vectors, thus reducing the vicious situation of network abuse by bots, data/privacy leakage and cross-node status differences.</li></ol><h2 id=advanced-request-handler>Advanced request handler</h2><p>IceGiant node can choose to be equipped with an advanced request processing gateway, the core of which is an application middleware, which can contain complex business logic to define database interaction. This can develop the function of IceGiant node from database/data storage system to a fully functional decentralized API system. Examples of high-level request gateways that can be built include: fine-grained database access, complex aggregate queries and concurrent queries, and rules of which data to pass to IceGiant synchronizer for propagation.</p><p>For example, we can build a multi-tenant management page to run on an advanced request gateway, which manages application-specific logic. The advantage of such a system is that it only needs one gateway to verify access rights.</p><h1 id=smart-contracts>Smart contracts</h1><h2 id=transaction-structure>Transaction Structure</h2><p>IceGiant blocks are stored in JSON format when submitted to smart contracts. Because each IceGiant node can serve multiple data sets, a single smart contract transaction can contain multiple blocks.</p><p>In each JSON, the top key is the name of the data set referenced by the data. Below the key in the first layer is the request endpoint that receives data writes. After the data is divided by the request endpoint, all data writes are sorted in chronological order.</p><h2 id=contract-interaction>Contract interaction</h2><p>The main functions of data set existence, ownership and verification come from intelligent contracts, which are mainly used to construct data set isolation, data reading and writing logs, fund pool, data legality and consistency verification.</p><h1 id=index-tracking-block-metadata>Index: tracking block metadata</h1><h2 id=igfi-token>$IGFI token</h2><p>The native token of IceGiant and IceFireDB ecosystem is $IGFI token, which has the following purposes:</p><ol><li>The main purpose of the token is to let interested parties verify the incoming blocks of the database. This can occur in the form of stakeholders running peer verifier nodes, or by entrusting benefits to verifiers.</li><li>Token mechanism prevents network spam requests. As the name of the data set is unique, registering the data set consumes a small amount of tokens, creating a small entry barrier, which can be ignored by well-meaning users.</li></ol><h2 id=sales-verification-node-program>Sales Verification Node Program</h2><p>The master validator in the IceGiant validator pool is the node with the highest stake/delegated stake. This node can be managed by individuals/groups closely related to the project it serves, but in theory it can be run by any third party.</p><p>The lead validator is the default node to which any queries are sent and is responsible for serving all application data (this is the default, but not mandatory). In addition to tracking appropriate state changes, the master validator also runs a database that runs the active state of the dataset. The benefit of making this the default is that it significantly reduces the overall cost of maintaining the dataset for nodes. Projects can choose to create more &ldquo;expensive&rdquo; datasets and thus benefit from further decentralization, but in most use cases any further decentralization will result in diminishing marginal utility.</p><p>Any stake owned or delegated to the master validator cannot be taken away until the validator&rsquo;s most recent block is complete. Once a block is mined by the new lead validator, the lead validator can remove their stake from the pool. The lead validator can request to unmark when mining its final block, preventing the token from being locked into its role.</p><h2 id=peer-verifier>Peer verifier</h2><p>Any validator that is not a leader is a peer validator, and by default it is the role of a peer validator to track incoming data writes and ensure that these writes are properly stored on IPFS by the master validator.</p><p>Peer validators may also choose to maintain an active state of the database, allowing them to be queried just like the master validator. Some network users may want to do this as it acts as a mechanism to eliminate the risk of network downtime. Additionally, the highest-level validators may have a vested interest in maintaining the active state of the database as they become the next primary validator at any time.</p><h1 id=funding-pool-multi-chain-support>Funding pool: multi-chain support</h1><h2 id=evm-multi-chain-fund-pool>EVM multi-chain fund pool</h2><p>Funding pools enable individuals and communities to pay for data usage on any number of blockchains. The fund pool is just a smart contract that holds funds for the validator and can be used to incentivize the validator to act correctly, and the tokens in the fund pool are used to pay the operator&rsquo;s storage, computing and hardware costs.</p><p>A dataset can have any number of pools. When creating a pool, the creator can specify the chain, token, and validator that the pool is bound to. This allows users to pay into the IceGiant network with any ERC20 equivalent token. By allowing payments in any token, IceGiant creates a chain-agnostic NoSQL database that utilizes smart contracts as a state tracking layer.</p><h1 id=application-scenario>Application Scenario</h1><p>IceGiant can provide efficient, secure and sustainable data solutions for different users, applicable to a variety of data application scenarios.
